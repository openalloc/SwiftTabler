# SwiftTabler

A multi-platform SwiftUI component for tabular data.

**NOTE** <em>this component is BRAND NEW and under active development. If you need stability, you should fork, at least until the API has stabilized with version 1.x.x.</em>


Available as an open source library to be incorporated in SwiftUI apps.

_SwiftTabular_ is part of the [OpenAlloc](https://github.com/openalloc) family of open source Swift software tools.

## Features

* Convenient display of tabular data from a `RandomAccessCollection` or Core Data source
* Presently targeting macOS v11+ and iOS v14+\*
* Supporting bound and unbound arrays, and Core Data too
* With bound data, add inline controls to interactively change (and mutate) your data model
* Optional sort-by-column support, with concise syntax
* Optional support for colored rows, with selection overlay
* MINIMAL use of View erasure (i.e., use of `AnyView`), which can impact scalability and performance\*\*
* No external dependencies!

For List-based tables:
* Optional moving of rows through drag and drop
* Support for no-select, single-select, and multi-select

For ScrollView/LazyVStack-based tables:
* Support for no-select and single-select (possibily multi-select in future)

For ScrollView/LazyVGrid-based tables:
* Likely the most scalable and efficient, but least flexible

On macOS:
* Hovering highlight, indicating which row the mouse is over

\* Other platforms like macCatalyst, iPad on Mac, watchOS, tvOS, etc. are poorly supported, if at all. Please contribute to improve support!

\*\* AnyView only used to specify sort configuration images in configuration, which shouldn't impact scalability.

## Tabler Example

The basic example below shows the display of tabular data using `TablerList`, which is for the display of unbound data without any selection capability.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Tabler

struct Fruit: Identifiable {
    var id: String
    var name: String
    var weight: Double
    var color: Color
}

struct ContentView: View {

    @State private var fruits: [Fruit] = [
        Fruit(id: "üçå", name: "Banana", weight: 118, color: .brown),
        Fruit(id: "üçì", name: "Strawberry", weight: 12, color: .red),
        Fruit(id: "üçä", name: "Orange", weight: 190, color: .orange),
        Fruit(id: "ü•ù", name: "Kiwi", weight: 75, color: .green),
        Fruit(id: "üçá", name: "Grape", weight: 7, color: .purple),
        Fruit(id: "ü´ê", name: "Blueberry", weight: 2, color: .blue),
    ]
    
    private var gridItems: [GridItem] = [
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 35, maximum: 40), alignment: .leading),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 100), alignment: .leading),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 40, maximum: 80), alignment: .trailing),
        GridItem(.flexible(minimum: 35, maximum: 50), alignment: .leading),
    ]

    private func header(_ ctx: TablerSortContext<Fruit>) -> some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
            Text("ID")
            Text("Name")
            Text("Weight")
            Text("Color")
        }
    }
    
    private func row(_ element: Fruit) -> some View {
        LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
            Text(element.id)
            Text(element.name).foregroundColor(element.color)
            Text(String(format: "%.0f g", element.weight))
            Image(systemName: "rectangle.fill").foregroundColor(element.color)
        }
    }

    var body: some View {
        TablerList(config,
                   headerContent: header,
                   rowContent: row,
                   results: fruits)
            .padding()
    }
    
    private var config: TablerListConfig<Fruit> {
        TablerListConfig<Fruit>(gridItems: gridItems)
    }
}
```

## Tables

You can choose from any of eleven (11) variants, which break down along the following lines:

* List-based, ScrollView/LazyVStack-based, and ScrollView/LazyVGrid-based
* Selection types offered: none, single-select, and multi-select, depending on base
* Unbound elements in row view, where you're presenting table rows read-only\*
* Bound elements in row view, where you're presenting tables rows that can be updated directly (see Bound section below)

Base   | Selection of rows | Element wrapping  | View name     | Notes
---    | ---               | ---               | ---           | ---
List   | No Select         | (none)            | TablerList    |
List   | No Select         | Binding\<Element> | TablerListB   |
List   | Single-select     | (none)            | TablerList1   |               
List   | Single-select     | Binding\<Element> | TablerList1B  | 
List   | Multi-select      | (none)            | TablerListM   |
List   | Multi-select      | Binding\<Element> | TablerListMB  |
Stack  | No Select         | (none)            | TablerStack   |
Stack  | No Select         | Binding\<Element> | TablerStackB  |
Stack  | Single-select     | (none)            | TablerStack1  |           
Stack  | Single-select     | Binding\<Element> | TablerStack1B | 
Grid   | No Select         | (none)            | TablerGrid    | Experimental. Needs bound version, select, etc.

\* 'unbound' variants can be used with Core Data (where values are bound by alternative means)

## Column Sorting

Column sorting is available through `tablerSort` view function.

From the demo app, an example of using the sort capability, where an indicator displays in the header if the column is actively sorted: 

```swift
private typealias Context = TablerContext<Fruit>
private typealias Sort = TablerSort<Fruit>

@ViewBuilder
private func header(_ ctx: Binding<Context>) -> some View {
    LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
        Sort.columnTitle("ID", ctx, \.id)
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.id) { $0.id < $1.id } }
        Sort.columnTitle("Name", ctx, \.name)
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.name) { $0.name < $1.name } }
        Sort.columnTitle("Weight", ctx, \.weight)
            .onTapGesture { tablerSort(ctx, &fruits, \.weight) { $0.weight < $1.weight } }
        Text("Color")
    }
}
```

When the user clicks on a header column for the first time, it is sorted in ascending order, with an up-chevron "^" indicator. If clicked a successive time, a descending sort is executed, with a down-chevron "v" indicator. See `TablerConfig` for configuration.

For sorting with Core Data, see the _TablerCoreDemo_ app.

## Bound data

:---:|:---:

When used with 'bound' variants (e.g., `TablerListB`), the data can be modified directly, mutating your data source. From the demo:

```swift
@ViewBuilder
private func brow(_ element: Binding<Fruit>) -> some View {
    LazyVGrid(columns: gridItems) {
        Text(element.wrappedValue.id)
        TextField("Name", text: element.name)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Text(String(format: "%.0f g", element.wrappedValue.weight))
        ColorPicker("Color", selection: element.color)
            .labelsHidden()
    }
}
```

## Colored Rows

:---:|:---:
![](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftTabler/blob/main/Images/macOSc.png)  |  ![](https://github.com/openalloc/SwiftTabler/blob/main/Images/iOSc.png)

The demo app (link below) shows how colored rows are implemented. 

Because the normal selection is obscured with colored rows, the ability to use a 'selection overlay' is provided. An example is available in the demo.

## Disable Header

The demo app shows how to toggle the display of the header, where a header may not be desired.

## Moving Rows

TODO add details here, with example of move action handler.

## Horizontal Scrolling

On compact displays you may wish to scroll the table horizontally. _TablerDemo_ does this through a `ScrollView` wrapper:

```swift
public struct SidewaysScroller<Content: View>: View {
    var minWidth: CGFloat
    @ViewBuilder var content: () -> Content

    public init(minWidth: CGFloat,
                @ViewBuilder content: @escaping () -> Content)
    {
        self.minWidth = minWidth
        self.content = content
    }

    public var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { geo in
            ScrollView(.horizontal) {
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    content()
                }
                .frame(minWidth: max(minWidth, geo.size.width))
            }
        }
    }
}
```
